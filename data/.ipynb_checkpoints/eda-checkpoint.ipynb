The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.\\n\\nM: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.\\n\\nO: Tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to pound down for a long time.\\xa0777 charactersTheManiacalOne, Feb 14, 2016', u'16 oz can.  Hazy amber with thin off white head, spotty lace.  Mild fruity hop aroma.  Taste is light toasty malt with some hop bitterness, but mostly just back end bitterness.

Thin mouthfeel.\\xa0302 charactersNolaHopHead, Dec 30, 2015', u'First beer from this brewery, a new VT brewery, neat.

Then hops, grassy a little earthy spicy, touch fruity as well, some melon rind notes, zest. Then mild fruity ester profile in the background it seems like.

It has a bit of a mineral quality to me, that isn't bad, but it's there - in fact, gives it a bit more character.  I like the taste of malt mixed in with some more honey notes.

A small foamy ring results after the cap dies down fairly quickly and lacing exists in a few sheets.\\n\\nS- Right about at the median of hoppy and malty with citrus hops bouncing off of toasted, browned grains. Grapefruit and orange brightness plays off of toast, medium Crystal caramelized grains and yeast bread.\\n\\nT- Plays a similar tune to the aroma but for some reason feels watered down at this point with the same balance of hops and malts at about fifty-fifty. Grapefruit, orange citrus, tea and floral-herbal-grassy hop notes atop a base of toasted barley, bread crust, caramel, apple esters and medium sweetness.\\n\\nMF- Light to medium overall thickness with a moderate level of carbonation. The bubbles promote a texture that is only slightly frothy and feels a bit thin/watery. An herbal bitterness lingers in the finish.\\n\\nStarts off well but with time it ends up feeling a bit thin and watered down.

Is this going to blow your mind?  Probably not.  It is, however, a very well made beer that captures the essence of an American Amber ale while not being overly aggressive.  Hop freaks might not appreciate that it's not as juicy as an IPA, but one of the beautiful things about the style is that it has plenty of latitude to represent the brewer's interpretation.  14th Star clearly prioritized balance over hops, and they've done an excellent job of executing their vision here.\\xa0527 charactersacread, Aug 03, 2015\", u'This feels like an amateur brew to me.

Smells like Valor to me! Mouthfeel was rather thin. The hops were initially prevalent on the tongue with a grassy, minty bite. This gave \\'way to a toasty biscuity malt flavor that really worked well as a counterbalance. It provided me a nice break from my recent spate of Cascadian IPAs and the upcoming onslaught of AIPAs.

Quick paced effervesce races up along the vessel walls while the head retains for several minutes leaving a thin, snake skin band of lace. \\n\\nS: Mid-range level of chocolate-coffee roast, warm roasted nuts with lightly dry toffee-caramel sweetness. \\n\\nT: Flavor was creamy with some oats and wheat, chocolate and dry toffee-caramel nuttiness. Some spiciness of cardamon, cola and a smooth roasty chocolate-coffee taste that finishes out with light creamer notes. \\n\\nM: Good rate of carbonation, mid-body fullness with a creamy soft feel. \\n\\nO: Overall decent rate of drinkability, spicy cola, roasty-chocolate flavor with a soft wheat palate. Cleanly brewed, sweet, almost like an after dinner dessert/coffee treat.\\xa0821 charactersbeerthulhu, Jun 13, 2014', u\"This is my fave of 16 mile a great local brewer of brown ales, every pub in mid-atlantic should carry them.\\n\\nA: Bottle poured into Leffe chalice, results in fast fade head with not much lacing.... but... it's a beautiful clear mahogany brown. Loveliest color on a brown beer that I've seen. \\n\\nS: Caramel, spice, cinnamon - almost cola like. and dried grass, woody, barnyard, hay, autumn. \\n\\nT: More of the aromas, with creamy maltiness, moderate body, toasty, chestnuts, chocolate, very interesting and original - best brown ale yet? Finishes with nice bitter, no sweet residue despite the many sweet spectrum flavors: fig, coffee, cake. \\n\\nF: Nice feel, more body that most brown ales, good weight, low carbonation, nice finish. Great with food - in this case sausage white bean garlic cassolet dressed up with fresh chard, tomatoes, fennel seed from garden. \\n\\nBest from 16 mile.\\xa0878 charactersAct25, Aug 12, 2013\", u'A: The beer is clear but very dark garnet red in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a thin off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass.\\nS: Light to moderate aromas of dark and nutty malts are present in the nose.\\nT: The taste is similar to the smell but seems to be a little more complex with notes of chocolate malts and hints of coffee. Although no bitterness is detectable, there are enough underlying hops to prevent any sweetness from becoming perceptible.\\nM: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.\\nO: Drinking this beer is a breeze given its light-bodied nature and low alcohol content. I would have no problem drinking an entire 6-pack of this in one sitting.\\xa0828 charactersmetter98, Jul 26, 2013', u'Pour is a dark muddy, murky brown. Scant light tan head, with lingering lace.\\n\\nNose is pretty malty, lots of sugary sweetness too. Brown sugar, caramel, and a slight sticky hop.\\n\\nTaste pretty sweet up front. Flavors of chocolate, brown sugar, molassess and a slightly roasty malt. Follows with a very mild hop, but finishes with a bitter coffee bite.\\n\\nBody is medium thin. A little watery.\\n\\nInteresting beer. Flavors are interesting, but not sure they really blend nicely into one another. Mouth feel especially is a bit lacking, really could use a little more beef. Would not be a bad session ale on a crisp fall evening, but there are better versions out there.\\xa0663 charactersdheacck11, Jun 15, 2013', u\"First had: on tap at 16 Mile\\n\\nNames can be deceiving... I expected a marzen or some kind of lager here, but instead I got a rather tasty brown ale. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this one was surprisingly good.\\n\\nDeep, dark brown pour, with a nice off-white head that retained well and left some lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, slightly roasty, toasted bread, nutty, slight spiciness. Rich malty taste, caramel, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, nice leafy / herbal hop profile bringing in a balance and leaving a pleasantly dry finish. Medium body, very nice mouthfeel for the style. Most likely the best brew I sampled at 16 Mile.\\n\\nNot sure how this beer translates in a bottle, but on tap, I definitely recommend it!\\xa0734 charactersRifugium, Apr 03, 2013\", u\"Pours a very dark chestnut brown color with faint mahogany edges and a frothy, one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. \\xa0Streaks of soapy lacing left behind.\\n\\nToasted dark malt aroma with subtle roasted coffee, caramel,\\xa0toffee and cocoa. \\xa0There's a faint grassy hop presence but the nose is dominated by subtle roast and caramel malt sweetness.\\n\\nOn the lighter end of medium bodies with a flavor profile that's very similar to the aroma. \\xa0There is a very delicate, crisp hop bite up front but the dominant flavors here is slightly roasted sweet malt. \\xa0Hints of caramel, toffee and nut countered by autumnal spice and toasted bread. \\xa0Not very complex but pleasant enough and easy to drink.\\xa0720 characterscorby112, Feb 08, 2013\", u\"Cheers to THE CPJ!\\n\\nPours a dark brown with a fluffy ivory head that settles to a nice cap. Mild aromas of caramel malt, brown sugar, and baked bread. Typical Brown Ale, but not unpleasant. More caramel and baked bread, with mild floral hops. Nicely drinkable, but nothing new. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium body and decent carbonation. Ehh...not bad. Wouldn't pick it up again.\\xa0383 charactersjsanford, Dec 11, 2012\", u\"Picked this up at Gary's in Wayne last weekend. I had never heard of 16 Mile before and thought this would be a slightly different take on what is normally an easygoing style. This was just bit more aggressive than a typical English Brown Ale in terms of alcohol and hops but it was nothing earth-shattering either of those departments. Less sticky and more like a dessert beer than what the category would imply, I enjoyed this and thought it was a good brew to keep warm with during the recent cold nights!\\n\\nThe pour to this was dark brown with a bit of garnet around the edges. The head was present but faded quickly and there wasn't much of any carbonation to be seen. Lots of coffee and bitter chocolate in the nose and even more in the taste, with the mouthfeel having quite a bit of toffee to help bring the hops out. It's not a strong burn but this seemed like a light espresso in terms of taste and body, as this was quite thin. A hint of pumpernickel could be found in the back without too much of dough of thickness in the aftertaste. \\n\\nTo be sure, the booze is here but it took a while for it to kick in. There wasn't any caramel or sugary sweetness here like in so many other Brown Ales and for a slightly more aggressive take on the style, this fit the bill nicely. Subtly enjoyable, this fits the season nicely now that the Octoberfests and Marzens are off the shelf. Worth a go for fans of smooth, dark ales.\\xa01,424 charactersJerzDevl2000, Nov 14, 2012\", u\"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date.\\n\\nLOOK: Sufficient sticky tan lacing, dark brown with garnet highlights\\n\\nSMELL: Dried grass, toasted grain, slightly biscuity, faintness of figs, nutty, herbal, chicory, carob, woody, yeasty\\n\\nTASTE: Subtle smoothness, creamy maltiness, moderate sized body, toasty, chestnuts, faint chocolate, modest bitterness, light coffee, leafy hops, mild spiciness, yeasty semi-dry finish\\n\\nYou've got to let this baby warm up a bit, like with nearly every beer it reaches a peak.

Very nice!\\xa0651 charactersJason, Oct 17, 2012\", u'12oz bottle into a standard pint glass. The brew appears a dark brown with a finger of dark tan head. When held to the light, it shows lighter brown clarity around the edges and ruby hints through the body. \\n\\nThe aroma is rich with cocoa and toffee sweetness. Some burnt sugar quality mixes with a fresh scent of sweet grain and just a mild touch of alcohol and fruity to floral and hebal hops.\\n\\nThe taste includes somw fruity alcohol esters that blend with a note of fruity to floral hops. The malt is less chocolate-like than the aroma leads on and more focused on toffee/caramel. Overall it is well blended amd enjoyable just with a bit too much focus on residual sugar.\\n\\nThis is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A pleasant take on the style with a nice balance of flavor and easy drinking smooth feel. The alcohol is well integrated. My only gripe is the residual sweetness seems a bit much and is the only thing keeping me back from throwing a couple down back to back.\\xa0999 charactersstakem, Oct 12, 2012', u'Served on-tap at On the Rocks in Lewes Beach, Del.\\n\\nA: Poured a deep, ruddy brown color with a two-finger head of creamy tan foam. Carbonation looked ample around the reddish-toned edges of the brew.\\n\\nS: Nice, sweet coffee and cocoa nib aroma in the nose. Blends with some earthy malts and a slight, herbal hop tinge.\\n\\nT: Smooth, roasted mellow malt flavor with lots of baked bread and chocolate on the plate. The finish nears a bittersweet coffee flavor blended with mild, spicy hops and a slightly nutty roasted aftertaste.\\n\\nM: Slightly creamy with a balanced mouthfeel in the finish.\\n\\nO: A nice, bold English brown ale with a subdued hand of American hops. The English malts are the showcase here, with a slightly jacked 6.1% ABV that only adds to the mellow, sweet warmth of the brew. I really enjoyed it and would certainly get it on-tap again.\\xa0849 charactersGambrinus1184, Jul 12, 2012', u\"A: I received this beer with absolutely no head. Probably due to the bartender, so I won't count that against it. Light dark brownish color, with slight hue\\n\\nS: Roasted coffee and a slight nutty smell\\n\\nT: Falls in line with the smell.

Moderate retention and lacing. \\n\\nS: Lots of caramel, coffee, and some nuts. Overall it has a nice toasty aroma. \\n\\nT: Similar to the aroma, very toasty and nutty. Some caramel and very light bitterness. Definitely on the maltier side. \\n\\nM: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. \\n\\nO: A pretty solid brown ale. Hope that 16 Mile puts this one into their regular line up sooner than later.\\xa0484 charactersmdaschaf, Dec 15, 2011', u\"As a preface, I was on business and given a 2/3 full growler by a colleague, as we didn't have time to make it to the brewery for lunch. It then rode around in my car and on an airplanefor two days before getting back to the fridge. Therefore, I cannot speak to its freshness. \\n\\nMore orange than brown, it rings of an Oktoberfest. Little head, but some of it may have been lost in transit. \\n\\nSweetly malted, almost like a big bottle of maple syrup. \\n\\nMalted and nutty, it echoes tobacco, brown sugar, and a hint of smokiness. Uniquely tasty - more flavor than most brown ales I've had. Actually harkens more to the 'Fests of the season than it does any brown. Very little hint of any alcohol.\\n\\nSeems to retain carbonation in the mouth that I thought might have been missing upon the pour.\\n\\nActually a pretty good beer, especially given its travel conditions. Great for the fall.\\xa0878 charactersmdcrouser, Oct 10, 2011\", u\"Reviewed from notes: had this with Thanksgiving Dinner.\\n\\nappearance: brown with orangish hue and a 2 finger off white head\\n\\nsmell: roast, caramel, nuts, malts\\n\\ntaste: roasted malts, caramel, \\n\\nmouthfeel: mild carbonation, medium body,\\n\\noverall: this is by far the best beer they have produced. only problem is they only bottle a limited # of this beer. here's to brewing this beer again.\\n\\nCheers,\\nThe CPJ\\xa0404 charactersTHECPJ, Aug 04, 2011\", u\"Wow, if you like full bodies, high flavor drinkable beers and aren't in the mood for hops, this is the beer. Dark brown pour, not quite black. Creamy dark head. Smells a little nutty but not too much. Taste is fantastic, it's chewey yet easily drinkable. This is easily my go to Fall Beer, I just with they made more of it. I've had it in the bottle, growler, and draft serving. Bottles are hand bottled on site in champagne bottles, not much to the bottle but that's kind of nice. I hope they brew this again in the fall.\\xa0522 charactersdhartogs, May 12, 2011\", u\"Poured from a capped, brown 750ml bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. No indication of year or best by date. There is a blank white area on the label which looks like it might normally hold that info, but I wonder if the trading source got this from someone at the brewery. No matter.\\n\\r\\nPours a deep, rich brown with very nice ruby highlights. A loose tan foam puts up a decent effort, but ultimately can't muster more than a ring around the edge of the surface. \\n\\r\\nAroma is very clean with nearly perfect toasty notes without tipping over into stout roast territory. Very impressive. Earthy hops blend very well with the roast to give a quite harmonious aroma. \\n\\r\\nFlavor is a fantastic blend of the same earthy flavors, but with a touch more bready balance. The hop aroma, flavors and bitterness are nearly perfectly balanced with the malty backbone. \\n\\r\\nMouthfeel is a touch lighter and more carbonated than what expect, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience significantly. Finish is dry and toasty leaving me ready for more.\\n\\r\\nDrinkability is also very high. There is no indication of abv on this bottle, but it doesn't seem to be very high. I'd have to guess in the 5.5 range. This is really quaffable brew that I enjoy more and more as I drink it. \\n\\r\\nOverall, this is my first experience with 16 Mile, but I am impressed. For many BAs who are stuck in the imperial double every world, this may not impress. However, for those who have a taste for quality of even humble styles, this is a real treat.\\xa01,524 charactersgwguest, Feb 13, 2011\"]),\n",
